## Introduction


This is a file directory browser script written in Node (TS/JS).

This is designed to be a image and video friendly Indexer, while also being an Indexer that has all of the other features that you can expect from most directory listers out there. It can be heavily customized, and has a design that attempts to be appealing while also being functional and easy to use.

***Note: The Indexer can be used without JavaScript, but it is needed for the extra functionality.***
